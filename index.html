       <h2 class="tittle">Helsey- You should be sad</h2>
       <p class="text">I wanna start this out and say <br>
        I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)<br>
        I got no anger, got no malice<br>
        Just a little bit of regret (Regret)<br><br>
        Know nobody else will tell you<br>
        So there's some things I gotta say<br> 
        Gonna jot it down and then get it out<br>
        And then I'll be on my way<br><br>
        No, you're not half the man you think that you are<br>
        And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs,<br>
        and cars<br>
        I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you<br>
        'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you...</p>
